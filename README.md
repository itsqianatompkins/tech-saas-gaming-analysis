# SaaS Business Impact Through Analytics: A Multi-Domain Case Study in Gaming Commerce 

# Background 

GameGalaxy, a fictional global gaming retailer, sells digital games, consoles, and accessories across multiple platforms including web, mobile, and console marketplaces. As the company expands internationally, leadership has identified several challenges:

  - Revenue growth has plateaued, and it’s unclear which products or platforms contribute the most value.

  - Marketing spends have increased, but channel performance and ROI are not well understood.

  - Customers in certain countries report slow shipping, raising concerns about logistics efficiency.

  - Leadership wants to know why some customers make repeat purchases while others churn.

To address these issues, GameGalaxy leadership posed the following key questions:

  1. Which products, platforms, and marketing channels drive the highest revenue and customer lifetime value?

  2. How do shipping times vary by region, and do delays impact repeat purchases?

  3. What segments of users (by country, behavior, or acquisition method) generate the highest long-term value?

  4. What operational inefficiencies or bottlenecks are slowing growth?

GameGalaxy has collected detailed transactional, behavioral, and operational data — but it has not yet been synthesized into a unified view that leadership can use to guide strategic planning.
